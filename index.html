<h2>Learning to Bake</h2>             <p>I have loved to bake for as long as I can remember. Some of my earliest memories are of helping my mom set up our bread machine in the morning. Several of my brothers and I had food allergies as children, so my mom made a lot of foods from scratch. In addition to bread, we would also make muffins, cakes and pies together. There is something so comforting about the smell and taste of a fresh-baked treat right out of the oven. This practice has stuck with me throughout my life and I love the feeling of creating delicious breads and pastries for myself and others to enjoy. </p>
   <blockquote>Baking and love go hand in hand,<br>
        for as one bakes a tasty treat<br>
        and fills the room with its sweet aroma,<br>
        the true joy is to take what has<br>
        been made and share it with another.<br><br>

    <h2>Healthy Baking</h2>             
<p>Although I could easily devour sweet snacks and fresh loaves of bread daily, I would likely gain a fair amount of weight, so I attempt to include a large of variety of more healthy recipes in my diet. Some of my more recent favorites, such as Paleo Brownies, use ingredients such as almond meal and mashed sweet potato, but still taste amazing. I also really enojoy making whole wheat breads, and some gluten-free breads as well, just for some varitey. I find that there are many ideas that make baking a more healthy endevor and yet still allow me to enjoy the lovely aroma and delightful taste of a homemade treat fresh from the oven.</p>
